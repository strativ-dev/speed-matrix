== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin break my website? =

Yes, you should always clear your cache after updating themes, plugins, or WordPress core to ensure changes are reflected correctly. Speed Matrix includes a one-click cache clearing button.

We recommend using only one caching plugin at a time to avoid conflicts. If you're already using another caching plugin, you may want to test Speed Matrix on a staging site first.

Speed Matrix works with most page builders including Elementor, Beaver Builder, Divi, and Visual Composer. Some JavaScript optimizations may require testing.
